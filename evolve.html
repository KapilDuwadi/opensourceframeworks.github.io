                    <p> EVOLVE is an opensource software framework developed using <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> at National Renewable Energy Laboratrory (NREL) in 2020.
                    This tool allows user to study impact on net load variation under the influence of electric vehicles, energy storage and solar. </p>

                            <h2>Electric vehicle consumption modeling</h2>
                            <p> Electric vehicles are new type of electrical loads and understanding their consumption pattern allows utilities
                                design policies for demand side management and many more. EVOLVE has in built python module that allows user to generate
                                synthetic profiles based on number and type of electric vehicles.

                            <p> Solar output from a solar installation depends on many factors such as irradiance, panel orientation, 
                                panel efficiecy etc. EVOLVE implements simplified solar modeling to compute solar output profile for a given 
                                size of PV installation.

                            <p> Energy storage plays a vital role in distributed energy resource (DER) integration in distribution feeder. EVOLVE has in built
                                storage model that user can interact with for different charging/discharging strategies (e.g time based, power based, price based). It also
                                has in built algorithm to determine best storage capacity as well as charging/discharging thresholds.

                            <p> In EVOLVE user can interact with easy to use interface developed using React to study net load variation under the influence of
                                electric vehicle, energy storage and solar panel. Results specific to each technologies can also be visualized in the dashboard. DER metrics such as peak reduction, 
                                load factor, ramp rate and energy consumption reduction are also included.

                    <mark>Load profile and DERs impact</mark>
                    <p>Time series energy consumption pattern of customers is known as load profile in power system lingo. Utilities use load profile
                        information to make various decisions such as power purchase, demand side management, asset upgrade and many more. Figure below shows hour resolution day long worth of synthetic load profile in orange color.
                        You can see consumption varies through out the day. Daily consumption pattern significantly changes between seasons, however remains more or less similar within seasons. Some utilities
                        might also observe drastic change in energy consumption pattern between weekday and weekend especially if the feeder is dominated by commercial and industrial customers. Now increasing installation of DERs on feeder also
                        change the energy consumption pattern. Battery less grid tied solar decreases the consumption during a day by providing local generation however consumption at other times remain almost unaffected. This is the reason
                        why some utilities might not see capacity value of solar especially when system peak is not during day time. Electric vehicles on the other hand increase consumption via battery charging. Residential electric vehicles tend
                        to increase energy consumption during night as most of them keep charging overnight whereas commercial charging station tend to increase consumption during a day.
                    </p>
                    <div id="tester"></div>

                    <p> Now utilities can leverage energy storage to manage load profile by discharging them during peak load and charging during off-peak load.
                        EVOLVE tool is designed to interact with all three technologies (electric vehicle, solar and energy storage) to study impact on load profile. It's simple yet powerful user interface
                        allows user to create customized scenario involving these technologies and visualize the impact on load profile. The results are analyzed in different temporal and spatial levels. The tool was developed
                        in collaboration with existing utility in India.
