                    This tool allows user to develop distribution feeder model using GIS data, develop customized solar deployment scenarios, compute and compare risk metrics at both system
                    and asset level and visualize them in an easy to use interactive dashboard.</p>

                            <p>Using EMeRGE, utilities can utilize their data to model and analyze the feeder. EMeRGE utilizes not only
                                technical information about assests present in the feeder but also low resolution consumer's energy consumption data as well as high resolution 
                            SCADA data to build time series load profile for different consumer's group. It also provides ability to model
                            classical PV (pv with unity power factor) as well as advanced PV (pv with advanced inverter functions). New metrics
                            are included to measure risk associated with assets and network. Interactive dashboard is also included to visualize metrics. </p>

                    <mark>Feeder model development</mark>

                    <p> Distribution feeder typically have radial structure with no loops and can contain one or more distribution
                        transformers. Modeling feeder requires information of distribution assets such as conductors, transformers, customers etc.
                        Distribution utilities also known as distribution companies typically store asset information in a geographic information system (GIS).
                        EMeRGE can automate the process of extraction of asset information stored in .shp files (file format typically used to store geographic data) and create 
                        close to accurate distribution feeder model in an OpenDSS format. <a href="https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/opendss">OpenDSS</a> is an open source distribution system simulator software developed by <a hred="https://www.epri.com">EPRI.</a>
                        The process of converting .shp files into .dss files (OpenDSS uses .dss file format to store distribution model) is as follows:

                        <ul>
                            <li> Assest information along with coordinates are extracted in .csv file format. For this EMeRGE leverages <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site">QGIS.</a>
                            </li>
                            <li> Once the csv files are generated, next process is to clean them. Cleaning involves removing unnecessary data and filling
                                missing data with appropriate values.
                            </li>
                            <li> EMeRGE has in built reader and writer to convert distribution asset information stored csv file to OpenDSS feeder model.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <mark class="highlight">Custom PV scenarios</mark>
                    <p>
                        To model the future solar or PV deployment scenarios four parameters namely number of customers with roof top PV, size of individual PV,
                        location of customers relative to substation, and voltvar setting for inverters can be configured in EMeRGE. Roof top PV is sized based on annual energy consumption before installing solar.
                        For e.g. if a customer has pre-solar annual energy consumption of 1000 kWh, and percentage energy consumption customer is willing to replace using PV is 50% then size of PV
                        required is equal to 1000x0.5/(365x24x capacity factor) kW. Now capacity factor of PV depends on many factors such as location, panel orientation etc. 
                        EMeRGE utilizes irradiance data of feeder location to compute the capacity factor and assumes maximum solar generation to reflect worst case scenario.
                        By default customers are randomly selected across the feeder for PV deployment but they also have flexibility to select customers near or far from the substation to define a scenario.
                        Scenario with customized voltvar settings for solar inverters can also be defined and simulated using EMeRGE.

                    <mark class="highlight">Risk metrics for both system and assets</mark>

                    <p> Generally, impact study for distrubution feeders due to emerging technologies involves assessing magnitude of violations (a violation in power system lingo means technical parameter such as 
                        voltage, thermal loading etc exceeding recommended thresholds values) across a sample of time stamps in whole year. The problem with this approach is that such violations may have occured for a 
                        very small period of time during whole year and risk associated with them might be lower or within the risk margin of utilities. EMeRGE uses risk metrics that look at severity and duration of violation along with 
                        number of customers present downward of the network in entire simulation time period to compute them.
                    </p>

                    <mark class="highlight">Interactive dashboard</mark>

                    <p> After metrics are computed by peforming time series powerflow results can be visualized in an interactive dashboard using EMeRGE. It also
                        uses geographic coordinates to plot the network and shows metrics on top of them. Using dashboard, user can also perform individual PV interconnecton assessment.
                        EMeRGE uses ploty to develop dashboard that can be launced in your favourite web browser.
